    title: Research
    intro: >
      My research focuses on making robots and cyberphysical systems safer.
      Soecifically, I am interested in Machine Learning (ML) components and how
      they impact the safety of the system. To that end, I have developed an
      effective and efficient tool to identify the hazard boundary of ML components
      via scalable parallel simulations. Furthermore, I am developing methods and
      tools to monitor the ML component during its operation at runtime.
      My research is supported by Auxon Corporation, Mitacs and Ontario Graduate Scholarship.
      
    assignments:
        - title: Runtime Safety Monitoring of Learned Components
          tagline: "This ongoing research focuses on developing safety monitors for learned
                    components."
        
        - title: Hazard Boundary Identification of ML-enabled Autonomous Systems
          tagline: "In this project we proposed MLCSHE, a cooperative coevolution algorithm
                    with a probabilistic fitness function to identify the hazard boundary
                    of a machine learning component which is embedded in an atuonomous system.
                    MLCSHE uses the actual system and scalable parallel simulations to identify
                    the hazard boundary."
        
#       - title: Engineering and Operating Safer ML-enabled Autonomous Systems
#         # link: "#hook"
#         tagline: "During this ongoing project, I am developing a heuristics approach to discover 
#                   hazardous scenarios of a machine learning component that result in a safety loss of an autonomous system.
#                   This project is part of a muliyear collaboration between Nanda Lab and Auxon Technolgies and is partially
#                   supported by Mitacs Accelerate Program, Ontario Graduate Scholarship and Canada Resarch Chair."

#         tagline: "During this project, I developed a tool-supported formal language model of smart contracts (contracts 
#                   with automated monitoring). The projects was supported by NSERC Strategic Grant and OGS."
